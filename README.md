# A Simple simpleExpress Example
## Purpose
This highlights a couple of awesome features this thing uses:

  - Auto loading of routes  
 Of all types(in file, required, middleware)

  - Auto loading of plugins

## Planned changes:
When updates happen to simpleExpress they'll be shown here! Seriously I'm lazy though... If you want to see more updates to this thing let me know.
